## ⚡ Two Ways to Deploy

### Option A: Automated (Easiest) 🤖

```bash
# Navigate to the directory
cd "/home/cpbjr/Documents/AI_Automation/Projects/Daily Summary/catholic-readings-api"

```

The script will:
1. ✅ Verify all files are present
2. ✅ Initialize git repository
3. ✅ Create initial commit with descriptive message
4. ✅ Set up remote connection to GitHub

## 💡 Why This Approach is Best

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`

**GitHub Pages vs Alternatives:**

**GitHub Pages (Our Choice) ✅**
- Free forever (no hosting costs)
- Global CDN (fast worldwide)
- CORS-enabled by default
- Automatic SSL/HTTPS
- Zero maintenance
- Built-in version control
- Highly discoverable (GitHub search)
- Reliable uptime (GitHub infrastructure)

**Alternatives (Less Optimal) ❌**
- **npm package**: Requires installation, not a REST API
- **Hosted server**: Costs money, maintenance, potential downtime
- **Git submodule**: Not accessible as API, requires cloning
- **CDN service**: May have rate limits, less discoverable
- **Cloud functions**: Costs money at scale, more complexity

**Result**: GitHub Pages is the perfect solution for a free, public, JSON-based API.

## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Issues:

**"Repository already exists"**
- Choose a different name, or delete the existing one

**"Authentication failed"**
- Use your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) as password
- Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

**"Permission denied"**
- Verify you own the GitHub account `cpbjr`
- Check repository is public, not private

**"GitHub Pages not working"**
- Wait 2-3 minutes after first deployment
- Verify Settings → Pages shows "Your site is published"
- Check branch is `main` and folder is `/ (root)`
